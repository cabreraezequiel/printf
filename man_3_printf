.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed
of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

%c  Prints a character.

%s  Prints a string.

%d  Prints an int number.

%i  Prints an int number.

%u  Prints an unsigned int number.

%b  Prints an int number in binary notation.

%o  Prints an int number in octal notation.

%r  Prints a string in reverse.

%x  Prints an int number in hexadecmal.lowercase.

%X  Prints an int number in hexadecmal.uppercase.

%p  Prints a address.

%S  prints a string with no printable characters.

%R  Prints a string in rot13 encryption.
